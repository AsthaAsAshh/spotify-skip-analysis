Spotify Skip Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes personal Spotify streaming history and builds a machine learning model to predict whether a song will be skipped.

📌 What I Did

* Cleaned and analyzed 149,000+ streaming records
* Identified top artists, tracks, and listening behavior
* Explored patterns in skipping and shuffle usage
* Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance
* Built and evaluated a Random Forest Classifier with **92.05% accuracy**

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python, Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn, SMOTE (imblearn)

📊 Key Visuals

* Top 10 Most Played Artists
* Skip Rate vs. Shuffle
* Monthly Listening Trend
* Feature Importance for Skips

🤖 Model Performance

* Accuracy: **92.05%**
* Model: Random Forest
* Balanced dataset using SMOTE
* Evaluated using confusion matrix & classification report
